        <h2>6. Dispute Resolution and Governing Law</h2>

        <p>YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT NEITHER INFER STUDIO NOR ITS OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, LICENSORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, AND AGENTS WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF INFER STUDIO HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, RESULTING FROM: (A) THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES OR ANY RELATED INFORMATION; (B) CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY (INCLUDING OTHER USERS) OF THE SERVICES; OR (C) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE SERVICES.
